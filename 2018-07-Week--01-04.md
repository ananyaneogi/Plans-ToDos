## Things I have doing since the last update

- [ ] Taking up React again, which I kind of left due to other things. Brushing up my existing knowledge!
- [ ] Learning Node.js(Express.js), which I wanted to learn from a very long time.
- [x] Started reading [JS Design Patterns by Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)


## Next Week's/Month's Plan

Continuing with React and go fully into the MERN stack. Hopefully! Fingers crossed!

### Life so Far
Feeling a little overwhelmed by everything. One of those feelings where you feel like you should be doing a lot of things and you're not doing enough! It's really easy to feel intimidated by the immense talent you come across on the internet where people are doing such "cool" things. But I am trying go on at my own pace and hopefully will reach that level someday ðŸ™‚
